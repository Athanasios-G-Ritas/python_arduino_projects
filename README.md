## These programs can used for any arduino UNO

## Connect circuit according to the sunfounder

### PROJECTS

**DIGITAL_DICE**:
This is a fun project where you use python to generate a random number to display on 7 segment display

Programs to start your arduino projects

### Basic programs

ard_test:
This is used to test the voltage of your arduiino

blinkled:
The program blinks led after a specified time delay

button_led:
This is used to turn on led using a button

led_pot:
Get the readings of your potentiometer

led_pwm_controlled:
The programs increases and decrease the brightness of led using pwm pin

switch_led:
Control your led using switch key

DC_motor_cont:
Control the direction and speed of your dc motor using arduino

RGB_led:
Control RGB led using arduino

flowing_led:
Turn on leds one after the other and simultaneously turninng off your previous led

Tkinter_led:
Turn on and off your led using tkinter(python GUI)

Tkinter_led_cont:
Control multiple LED lights using Tkinter
(there's a liitle problem in it but the programs still runs andd performs its task if someone finds a solution let me know)

7segmentdisplay:
Using this display numbers from 1 to 6
(You can add more numbers and letters according to the pin diagram)
